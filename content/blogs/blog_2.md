Hey reader, after a long break, here I am, back from my hiding. Since the last time I sat down to write a blog, the world has truly become a strange place. Well, atleast the tech landscape is now a strange place than ever before. Just last year, I had been yapping about "SSG", in my blog, and how it was empowering me to focus on content yada yada. Cut forward to now, I am left questioning my choices. The world has inarguably entered a new era. 

## Going with the vibes
On a fateful day in February 2025, a new notion emerged, casually tossed around by Andrej Karpathy on Twitter. Who knew there would be courses on this just after this notion was introduced! Every other person around me was giving it a whirl. If you still haven't figured out what I am talking about, you must be yoda...yoda GOAT who probably can center a div without "vibe coding" it, unlike every other "normal" person today!<img src="/blogs/center-div.jpg" alt="centerdiv meme" class="blog-images"/>  Anyway, coming back to my story, just a year ago, I had been going on and on about Zola and what not, but now would I go down the same road to create this blog? I really doubt it, because I guess I might have tried vibe coding the blogsite. Although, a year ago I claimed that I wished to focus on the content rather than re-invent the wheel all by myself. The irony! The advent of new AI tools and agents have definitely transformed many areas. What does this shift mean for an everyday user? The way I see it, this mental shift could be both beneficial and detrimental depending on the context. While it is totally subjective, I would like to touch upon my case here.

As for my case, I just wanted to create this blogsite to develop the habit of blogging, create a personalised space for myself, document my thoughts and more. As a developer, I was tempted to create all of it from scratch. I knew this was road to development hell and would never reach the actual goal this way. Hence, I gave SSGs a try. For me they gave the flexibility to customise while also saving development time. I spent less time meddling with boilerplate code. Had I created the blogsite today, I would have inadvertently turned to AI Tools to spin this up quickly. In the name of generating boilderplate code using AI, I would have still indirectly led myself into a development hell. No doubt debugging the mess I created using AI might have easily distracted me from my end goal. In this case, I could have used readymade solutions to my benefit, if I had decided to just focus on my end goal. Had I decided to create things from scratch, I would have probably benefitted from using AI. This is where the problem lies. Where do you draw the line? How do you strike a balance?


## Law of the instrument
I came across an interesting perspective while I was reading about design patterns in [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/criticism). This perspective resonated deeply with my thoughts on what we could possibly be experiencing today.

Upon digging deep I understood this referred to the cognitive bias called [the "law of the instrument" or "Maslow's hammer"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument). I feel this is still relevant today, with the tempting amount of possibilities AI has, we try to solve anything and everything we can with AI. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it as long as the end goal is achieved. The problem arises, when we try to force fit any new tech like AI, into some use cases without vetting it out. I feel sometimes the exciting possibilities overshadow some of the obvious limitations in such tools, resulting in wasted resources and time. Usage of AI would surely mature with time, integrating well within the system. But in certain cases today, the AI label is just being slapped on just about anything and they have crossed the line with the one below. <img src="/blogs/ai-powered-glass.jpeg" alt="ai glass meme" class="blog-images"/>

## In the end, does it even matter?
The AI wave has transformed many areas, claimed to disrupt some, but in the end, does it even matter? (Linkin Park yayy). Well, it does matter and it is here to stay. It sure is hard to ignore this. Everyday we see the AI race gathering heat and with so many AI-doomers and AI-hype-bros around, I feel comfortable treading a line by keeping a open mind. But I do sometimes wonder, are we headed towards Skynet? Or maybe are we waiting for our own Doraemon to jump out our desk drawer? All that aside, _**does it ever drive you crazy just how fast the night changes?**_ <img src="/blogs/night-changes.jpg" alt="1D meme" class="blog-images"/>
