Since the last time I sat down to write a blog, the world has truly become a strange place. Well, atleast the tech landscape is now a strange place than ever before. We were looking at a paradigm shift. Just last year, I had been yapping about "SSG", in my blog, and how it was empowering me to focus on the content yada yada. Cut forward to now, I am left questioning my choices. The world has inarguably entered a new era.<h2 id=going-with-the-vibes>Going with the vibes</h2><p>On a fateful day in February 2025, a new notion emerged, casually tossed around by Andrej Karpathy on Twitter. Everyone went crazy over this. Just like that new online courses on this, sprung up one after the other! Every other person around me was giving it a whirl. We were looking at a paradigm shift in the tech world. If you still are not sure what I am talking about, you must be yoda...yoda GOAT who probably can center a div without "vibe coding" it, unlike every other "normal" person today!<img alt="centerdiv meme" class=blog-images src=/blogs/center-div.jpg> Anyway, coming back to my story, just a year ago, I had been going on and on about Zola and what not, but now would I go down the same road to create this blogsite? I really doubt it, because I guess I might have tried vibe coding this or atleast try to use AI in some form to build it from scratch. But, a year ago I claimed that I wished to focus on the content rather than re-invent the wheel. The irony! The way I see it, this mental shift could be both beneficial and detrimental depending on the context. While it is totally subjective, I would like to touch upon my case here.<p>In my case, I wanted to create this blogsite to develop the habit of blogging, to create a personalised space for myself, document my thoughts and more. I knew writing all of it from scratch meant development hell in my case and would never reach the actual goal this way. I considered using blogging platforms but I wanted more options to customise to bring a personal touch and probably call it my own. Hence, I gave SSGs a try. For me they gave the flexibility to customise while also saving development time. I spent less time meddling with boilerplate code. Had I created the blogsite today, I would have inadvertently turned to AI Tools to spin this up quickly. In the name of generating boilderplate code using AI, I would have still indirectly led myself into a development hell, debugging the mess I created using AI. It would be the same rabbit hole I had tried to avoid from the beginning, but only this time it packaged with the possibilities of AI. But that said, had I decided to create things from scratch, I would have probably benefitted from using AI. But just because I CAN use such tools doesn't mean I always HAVE to. This is where the problem lies. Where do you draw the line? How do you strike a balance?<h2 id=law-of-the>Law of the</h2><p>I came across an interesting perspective while I was reading about design patterns in <a href=https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/criticism>Refactoring Guru</a>. This deeply resonated with my thoughts on what we could possibly be experiencing today.<blockquote><p><em><strong>If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.</strong></em></blockquote><p>Upon digging deep, I found out that this referred to the cognitive bias called <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument>Law of the Instrument or Maslow's hammer</a>. In the present context, with the tempting amount of portals AI opens up, we try to solve anything and everything we can with it.<img alt="hammer meme" class=blog-images src=/blogs/ai-hammer.png> There is absolutely nothing wrong with it as long as the end goal is achieved. The problem arises, when we try to force fit any new tech like AI, into some use cases without vetting it out. I feel sometimes the exciting possibilities overshadow some of the obvious limitations of such tools, resulting in wasted resources and time. Usage AI in many cases is surely maturing with time, integrating well within the system, finding its place. But in certain cases today, the AI label is just being slapped on just about anything and they have crossed the line with the one below. <img alt="ai glass meme" class=blog-images src=/blogs/ai-powered-glass.jpeg><h2 id=in-the-end-does-it-even-matter>In the end, does it even matter?</h2><p>The AI wave has transformed many areas, claimed to disrupt some, but in the end, does it even matter? (Linkin Park yayy). Well, it does matter and it is here to stay. It is hard to ignore the pace at which things are moving. Everyday we see the AI race gathering heat and with so many AI-doomers and AI-hype-bros around, I find myself comfortable treading the middle ground. But I do sometimes wonder, are we headed towards Skynet? Or perhaps are we waiting for our own Doraemon to jump out our desk drawer? All my musings aside, <em><strong>does it ever drive you crazy just how fast the night changes?</strong></em> <img alt="1D meme" class=blog-images src=/blogs/night-changes.jpg></section><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/dev/>dev</a></ul></nav></div></article></main></div>
