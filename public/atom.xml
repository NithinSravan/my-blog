        <content type="html" xml:base="/blogs/blog-2/">&lt;p&gt;Hey reader, after a long break, I&#x27;m back from hiding. Since the last time I sat down to write a blog, the world has truly become a strange place. Well, at least the tech landscape is now stranger than ever before. Just last year, I had been yapping about &quot;SSG&quot; in my blog, and how it was empowering me to focus on the content, yada yada. Cut forward to now, I am left questioning my choices. The world has inarguably entered a new era.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;going-with-the-vibes&quot;&gt;Going with the vibes&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a fateful day in February 2025, a new notion emerged, casually tossed around by Andrej Karpathy on Twitter. Everyone had gone crazy over this. Just like that, several new online courses on this sprung up one after the other! Every other person around me was giving it a whirl. If you still are not sure what I am talking about, you must be yoda...becuase yoda GOAT who probably can center a div without &quot;vibe coding&quot; it, unlike every other &quot;normal&quot; person today!&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;center-div.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;centerdiv meme&quot; class=&quot;blog-images&quot;&#x2F;&gt; Anyway, coming back to my story, just a year ago, I had been going on and on about Zola and what not, but now would I go down the same road to create this blogsite? I guess I might have considered vibe coding this or something. Yet, a year ago, I claimed that I wished to focus on the content rather than re-invent the wheel. The irony! The way I see it, this paradigm shift is still young and needs careful evaluation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I considered using blogging platforms to start churning out blogs, right off the bat. But I wanted a bit more customisation with a dash of personal touch, all of this free of cost. Finally, I tried this template-driven approach to spin this up. This gave me the flexibility to customise while also letting me focus on my content. I spent less time meddling with boilerplate code. Had I created this today, I would have inadvertently considered AI tools to spin this up quickly. The uber question is, do I have to use such tools? That&#x27;s a question one must ask before taking up any projects in the real world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that these tools enable me to get started on such projects pretty quickly. But just because I &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;can&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; use such tools doesn&#x27;t mean I &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;have&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to. Do I really have to build something using AI from scratch? Why not benefit from existing solutions? Does every single thing have to be DIY just because AI empowers you with rapid development? This is where the problem lies. Where do you draw the line? How do you strike a balance?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;law-of-the-instrument&quot;&gt;Law of the Instrument&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came across an interesting perspective while I was reading about design patterns in &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;refactoring.guru&#x2F;design-patterns&#x2F;criticism&quot;&gt;Refactoring Guru&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. This deeply resonated with my thoughts on what we could possibly be experiencing today.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon searching online, I found out that this referred to the cognitive bias called &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Law_of_the_instrument&quot;&gt;Law of the Instrument or Maslow&#x27;s hammer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. In the present context, with the tempting amount of portals AI opens up, we attempt to solve anything and everything we can with it.&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;ai-hammer.png&quot; alt=&quot;hammer meme&quot; class=&quot;blog-images&quot;&#x2F;&gt; There is absolutely nothing wrong with it as long as the end goal is achieved. The problem arises when we try to force-fit any new tech, like AI, into some use cases without vetting things out. I feel sometimes the exciting possibilities overshadow some of the obvious limitations of such tools, resulting in wasted resources and time. Usage of AI in many cases is surely maturing with time, integrating well within the system, and finding its place. But in certain cases today, the AI label is just being slapped on just about anything, and they have crossed the line with the one below. &lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;ai-powered-glass.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;ai glass meme&quot; class=&quot;blog-images&quot;&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-the-end-does-it-even-matter&quot;&gt;In the end, does it even matter?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AI wave has transformed many areas and claimed to disrupt some, but in the end, does it even matter? (Linkin Park yayy). Well, it does matter, and it is here to stay. It is hard to ignore the pace at which things are moving. Every day, we see the AI race gathering heat, and with so many AI-doomers and AI-hype-bros around, I find myself comfortable treading the middle ground. But I do sometimes wonder, are we headed towards Skynet? Or perhaps are we waiting for our own Doraemon to jump out of our desk drawer? All the musings aside, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;does it ever drive you crazy just how fast the night changes?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;night-changes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1D meme&quot; class=&quot;blog-images&quot;&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="/blogs/blog-1/">&lt;p&gt;Hello World! Welcome to my blog. Never created content before. Feels new. But nobody tells you how excruciatingly painful it is to find the motivation to start something. Procrastination is so addicting. You want more of it every time. For the record this particular blog post was supposed to go out yesterday or maybe some 3 months ago. &lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;blog_confusion_meme.png&quot; alt=&quot;blog  meme&quot; class=&quot;blog-images&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
That&#x27;s the thing with procrastination, you park your idea for really long you almost forget its existence. Now that I finally sat to do something about this, I was left with questions. Questions like, where should I start? What should I write? What&#x27;s for lunch? Will readers like my style of writing? What should I eat for dinner? Will I continue this blog? What should I name the blog? I have no answers for any of these. But it doesn&#x27;t matter because, here we are. My Hello World for blogs. Alright, but how did I finally make this happen?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ssgs-for-blogs&quot;&gt;SSGs for blogs&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site was created using a Static Site Generator (SSG) called &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getzola.org&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;getting-started&#x2F;overview&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Zola&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The junior-developer-me would want to create everything, including this blog site. If I had given in to my ego, I would&#x27;ve been writing code for the platform and not this post. &lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;dev_blog_meme.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;blog  meme&quot; class=&quot;blog-images&quot;&#x2F;&gt; It sure is an exciting project to do. But my focus is on the content and developing the habit of blogging. In fact, I got sidetracked multiple times from actually producing content. With my 9 to 5 job already taking up 60-80% of my time, I had given up multiple times already. This was one of the major reasons I chose an SSG since this helped me speed up this process and help me focus on my goal amidst my generally tumultuous workday (plus I am lazy and c&#x27;mon...who am I kidding...skill issues).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SSGs are a great way to start your custom blog site. This lets you focus on the task and speed up the process of setting things up. I started using Zola to spin up my site using a theme.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zola is a static site generator (SSG), similar to Hugo, Pelican, and Jekyll (for a comprehensive list of SSGs, please see Jamstack). It is written in Rust and uses the Tera template engine, which is similar to Jinja2, Django templates, Liquid, and Twig.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content is written in CommonMark, a strongly defined, highly compatible specification of Markdown. Zola uses pulldown-cmark to parse markdown files. The goal of this library is 100% compliance with the CommonMark spec. It adds a few additional features such as parsing footnotes, Github flavored tables, Github flavored task lists and strikethrough.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting Zola up and running on your machine is pretty straightforward. The initial setup and configurations might take some effort and time depending on your blogging requirements. But a huge coding effort is easily handled by the SSG and the rest is just styling, configuring, and handling data. Finally, choose your method of deployment and voila your blog is ready to go. I used &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getzola.org&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;deployment&#x2F;github-pages&#x2F;&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to deploy my site.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-this-blog&quot;&gt;Why this blog?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog is a way for me to help myself grow and explore more stuff. I wish to focus majorly on tech, but I do plan to sneak in some non-tech posts, where I talk about my interests, hot takes, and more. So stay tuned folks. Until next time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
